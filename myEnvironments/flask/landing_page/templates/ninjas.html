			<h1><em>Ninjas</em></h1>
			<p>
				A ninja (忍者?) or shinobi (忍び?) was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan.
				The functions of the ninja included espionage, sabotage, infiltration, assassination and guerrilla warfare.
				[1] Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed "dishonorable" and "beneath" the samurai-caste, who observed strict rules about honor and combat.
				[2] The shinobi proper, a specially trained group of spies and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period,
				[3] but antecedents may have existed in the 14th century,[4] and possibly in the 12th century (Heian or early Kamakura era).[5][6]
